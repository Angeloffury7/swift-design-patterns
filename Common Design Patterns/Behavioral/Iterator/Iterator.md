# Iterator Design Pattern
`Iterator` is a behavioral design pattern that provides a standardized interface for a collection of traversing elements. The collection of elements is represened as an *aggregate* object. The pattern decomposes iteration logic into separete *iterator* object. 

We can implement this pattern in a couple of different ways: we can implement the *iterator* and *iterable* protocols from scratch or we can use similar protocols that already offers standard library. The difference will be minimal, except you need some very sophisticated features.
