# Iterator Design Pattern
`Iterator` is a behavioral design pattern that provides a standardized interface for a collection of traversing elements. The collection of elements is represened as an *aggregate* object. The pattern decomposes iteration logic into separete *iterator* object. 

We can implement this pattern in a couple of different ways: by creating the *iterator* and *iterable* protocols from scratch or we can use similar protocols that already are offered by the Swift standard library. The differences between the approaches will be minimal, except you need some very sophisticated features.
