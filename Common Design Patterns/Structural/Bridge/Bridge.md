# Bridge Design Pattern
`Bridge` is a structural design pattern that is aimed to decouple the abstraction from the implementation. That is done to allow both vary independently. `Bridge` pattern adds an additional layer of abstraction that saves the code-base from unneeded refactoring and `class hierarchy explosion`. 

Class heirarchy explosion simply means that over time, when requirements change and more classes are added to hierarchies, it becomes  hard to control complexity and make the code manageable.
